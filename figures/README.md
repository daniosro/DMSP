## `figures`

This folder includes all the figures generated by the scripts in the code section, including all the figures in the main text and the supplementary materials of the paper. The figures are classified in the following subfolders:

 * **`data`**: Includes the figures generated from the raw and processed experimental data of enzymatic DMSP degradation.

  * **`enz_deg`**: Includes the figures produced from the experimental data and the modelling where a loss of Alma1 (eukaryotic DMSP lyase) activity was tested.

  * **`genetics`**: Includes the figures related to the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data for DMSP degradation enzymes from ocean expeditions.

  * **`modelling`**: Includes the figures generated by modelling to predict the sulfur isotopic composition that environmental DMSP should have from degradation by different process.
