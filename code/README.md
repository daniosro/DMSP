# `code`

In this directory, you find all the source code from the project, including that used for processing the data, doing the modelling, and generating all figures. It is divided in the following subdirectories:

 * **`processing`**: Includes all the code used to correct and transform the data. 
 * **`analysis`**: Includes the scripts used to make Michaelis-Menten fits, linear regressions, and other analysis of the data. 
 * **`modelling`**: Contains the scripts used to model the changes in the isotopic composition of DMSP in vitro (under a scenario of enzyme degradation) and in the environment (with multiple degradation pathways).
 * **`figures`**: Contains all the scripts used to generate the figures in the main text and the supplementary material. 
  * **`notebooks`**: Contains all the jupyter notebooks that describe the data treatment, modelling, and figure plotting.
